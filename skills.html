      <p class="skilltextleft">I have used python extensively and have made many small scale programs with it. It has been my favorite program to work with so far as it allows me to work with scripts in a wide variety of ways.</p>

      <p class="skilltextright">Blender is something I gained modest ground in that is until the laptop I had that could run it stopped working. Blender is a 3d animation engine used to make 3d models that work with python and c++. One of these days I plan on going back to it.</p>

      <p class="skilltextleft">Similar to many programmers, I began operating HTML. Honestly, I feel like it's almost definitely the easiest of the programming languages to learn and undoubtedly the most forgiving, at least to me.</p>

      <p class="skilltextright">CSS is a supportive program that works with HTML and works as a system to format HTML quicker and with greater ease than without. I have used CSS extensively to do nearly all my HTML formatting. I doubt one could argue CSS' usefulness despite not being necessary.</p>

      <p class="skilltextleft">Although I've hardly scratched the surface of Javascript, I can see the inevitable usefulness it possesses. Java is another partner application that works with HTML and it gives the programmer the ability to make their website dynamic using scripts.</p>
