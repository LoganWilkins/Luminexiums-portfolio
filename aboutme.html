        <h3>Technical Journey</h3>
        <p >Greetings, as you likely know already my name is Logan Wilkins. I've relished in video games for as long as I remember and like the typical programmer that passion brought me to programming. Ever since I first played Halo, my first game when I was four years of age, I was infatuated with the idea of building my own worlds for others to enjoy. As I grew my ideas, my worlds became plentiful and more meticulous. For my quest to create video games I began taking every “computer” class I could before I realized those were glorified writing classes and I stopped going to them. </p>
 
        
        <p>See those schools were cheap and a real coding class was beyond the capability, so they gave me what they referred to as the next best thing. Numerous years later, after my parents split, and I moved from that area I had access to quality schools, Schools that had classes that would teach actual code. I took as many coding classes as I could manage always desperate to learn more. At this point was when I learned HTML and CSS. Another couple of years pass and now I have my first computer, it was cheap but it was all I had, it lacked the capability to run any major application but I still used it to practice my code.</p>
 
        <p>Not even a year later I got a new computer from a the school I was going to. At Harding County High School I would talk to everyone and became friends with the guidance counceler, to my surprise the school had a christmas program where the counceler could choose a few student to give a give. I was one of the chosen a got my second computer. This computer was pretty good and was actually able to run much larger items, Now I started to practice using blender to make 3d models.</p>
 
        <p>Later during that year I also made my first website which I no longer have access to. During year 3 of high school was when coding got exciting for me because I was learning Python, because Python is able to run scripts and commands it was the closest thing I had to design a video game. I made several projects and worked with raspberry pi, which is beginners kit for working with machinery.</p>
 
        <p>Finally I found my way to base Camp Coding Academy down in water valley. At base Camp I was able to strengthen and fill the gaps of what I knew of python, HTML, CSS. Here I will learn how to make my code usable by websites learn Javascript, along with several other platforms and become that much closer to being a videogame designer.</p>
